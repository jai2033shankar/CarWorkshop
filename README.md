# CarWorkshop

## About:
CarWorkshop is a simple application, still in development, created because I 
want to learn how to create web applications. In it's finished state it should 
simulate management system for small car workshop. Clients should be able to 
check if their car is already repaired and how much they have to pay. How many 
repairs have been made to their car and so on. Employees should be able to 
set the start and the finish date of repair. Employer will have access to all 
of this information. Right now the app provides:
login system for clients,
creating client account - which also adds client to the database,
searching for client by email or by id.
So alot of functionalities are waiting to be implemented.

Main goal of this project is of course learning as much as possible.
Among the things I want to learn while developing this simple app are:
* .net core
* MVC
* EF core
* some t-sql
* Domain Driven Design
* Automapper
* HTML5, CCS3, Javascript
* How to write unit tests
* Polish my git skills
* Time will tell what else is going to get into my hands.
